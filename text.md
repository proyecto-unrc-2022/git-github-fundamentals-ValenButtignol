# Well, now I think it has to work

* Apparently, I can't open a pull request from first-draft-content to the main branch because their contents are entirely different commit histories.

* So I've created a new branch, and I'm adding this markdown text to complete the assignment and ask, _Why this happend?_

  * It confused me, because I thought that first-draft-content is a branch created from main. I mean, the only thing I can think of is that those branches were created separately.
